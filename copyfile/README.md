# File Copy Program

This Java program copies the contents of one file to another. It takes two command-line arguments: the source file to copy from and the destination file to copy to.

## Usage

To run the program, use the following command:

~~~bash
java Main source_file destination_file
~~~

## Notes

Before using this program, please keep the following points in mind:

- **Java Installation:** Make sure you have Java installed on your system. You can check if Java is installed by running `java -version` in your command prompt or terminal. If Java is not installed, you can download and install it from the official [Java website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).

- **Custom File Names:** You are not limited to using the provided `entrada.txt` and `saida.txt` file names. When running the program, you can specify your own source and destination file names as needed. Just replace `source_file` and `destination_file` in the command with your preferred file names.

- **Customization:** If you have specific requirements or need additional functionality, feel free to modify the Java code in `Main.java` to suit your needs. This program serves as a basic template for file copying and can be extended or adapted for various use cases.

Now, you're ready to copy files with ease! Happy file copying!
