# File Copy Program (Similar to `cp` in Linux)

This Java program is designed to perform the same task as the `cp` command in Linux, which is copying a file from a source location to a destination location. It provides a simple way to duplicate files in your system.

## Usage

To use this program, open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

~~~bash
java Main source_file destination_path
~~~

* source_file: The name of the file you want to copy.
* destination_path: The path where you want to copy the file.

## Notes
This program provides a basic file copy functionality similar to the Linux cp command.
Make sure you have Java installed on your system to run this program.
You can specify different source files and destination paths according to your requirements.
Now you can easily copy files in your system using this program, just like you would with the cp command in Linux!
